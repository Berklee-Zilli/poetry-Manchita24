Circle by Mic Miller
Well this is what It looks like
right before you fall
Stumblin' around, you've been
guessinf your direction
Next step you can't see at all
and i don't have a name,
I don't have , no
Who am i to blame,
who am i to balme though?
I cannot be changed
Trust me, I've tried
I just end up right at the start of the line.
